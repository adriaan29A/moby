## Introduction

The Moby Thesaurus is a delightful and eclectic work released into the public domain by Grady Ward in 1995 (see Wikipedia articles and contains 30,260 unique words and phrases in English. I combined it with word frequencies from Google's Trillion Word Corpus to create a word game. Browsing a thesaurus is a great way to discover new words and the frequencies    has two modes - browser and game. Browsing is self explanitory; you click on a term to find its related terms and discover the entire thesaurs Game mode starts with two words or phrases that are chosen in advance - The goal is to find a path between the two choosing the least common words as counted by their word frequencie


The object of the game is to find a path between two words or phrases consisting of their least common shared synonyms.  It can be quite a challenge just to find any path let alone the rarest terms. That's why I put in the option to "cheat". If you're stumped as to which synonym to click on you can click on the >> button (forward)) and moby will calculate then next best synonym for you and jump you to it from wherever you happen to be. Your score, if you even care, is comprised of 3 things - 2) The total cost (summed word frequencies of all the words or phrases you clcked on on your journey from the beginning to end) and 3) the number of cheats you resorted to to get there).
