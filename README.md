Game Edition

## Introduction

The Moby Thesaurus is a fun and eclectic work released into the public domain by Grady Ward in 1995 [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project) and contains 30,260 root terms and over 2.5 million synoyms & related terms in English. I combined it with word frequencies from Google's Trillion Word Corpus to see what kind of word game I could come up with and ended up with a kind of a word scavenger hunt. Along the way a kind of natural hyperlinked way of browsing the thesaurus fell out of it and you can also just browse without playing the game. Synonyms are displayed as "heat map word clouds" colored by raw word frequenies. These are also used to to provide a filtered view over the synonym sets, adding a "3rd" dimension in effect by simply redacting terms in an alphabetized paragraph.

The object of the game is to find a path starting from your current location to a target/destination synonym chosen by you or an adversary. The ideal path consists of the "rarest" (low frequency) *shared* synonyms from where you started to the chosen target. It can be quite a challenge just to find any path let alone along only the rarest. That's why you can "cheat": If you're stumped as to which synonym to click on next,the >> button (forward) will take you to the next best synonym from wherever you are. The << (back) button takes you back and +/- to zoom in and out. Your score, should you even care, is comprised of 3 things - 1) The total cost (summed frequencies of all the synonyms you clcked on on your journey from the beginning to end), 2) total number of jumps and 3) the number of cheats you resorted to to get there). There's usually more than one path, though none with a minimum cost of less than what is computed by the machine.
