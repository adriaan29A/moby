# The Moby Thesaurus
Game Edition (Now With Cheats!Â®)

## Introduction

The Moby Thesaurus is a delightful and eclectic compendium released into the public domain by Grady Ward in 1995 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project). It contains 30,260 root terms and over 2.5 million synoyms & related terms in English, replete with Americana and old colloquialisms through to the 1970s. I combined it with word frequencies from Google's Trillion Word Corpus with the vague idea of making a semantic word game. What I ended up with is a kind of a logophile's scavenger hunt with the goal of finding paths along shared synonyms forming chains between different entries in the thesaurus. In the process I stumbled upon a way of browsing the thesaurus in which synonyms are displayed in a 2D "heat map word cloud" of hyperlinks colored and filtered by their word frequencies. This provides an alternate way of browsing the thesaurus independent of it's usage in the game.

Game Mode

The object of the game is to find a path between different entries (the start and target). To play - navigate to a start word. Type in a target and click "Nav" (for Navigate)

The ideal path consists of the "rarest" (lowest frequency) *shared* synonyms between a start entry to a target. Terms opposite in meaning can work well but not always. It can be very challenging to find any path let alone one consisting of the rarest synonyms. Because of this there's a "cheat" option: If you're stumped the >> button (forward) will take you to the next best raarest synonym towards the target from wherever you are. The << (back) button takes you back and +/- to zoom in and out. Your score is updated at each step and has three components - 1) The total path cost (summed frequencies of all the entries visited), 2) the total number of entries visitid and 3) the total number of cheats resorted to. The minimum cost to the target is continuously updated from the current location. There's usually more than one path and it is sometimes possible to beat the algorithm by carefully observing how it works.

## Notes:
- Self contained ("static") React + Vite app, no server side component.
- Super alpha, plenty of warts. Out to the unwitting for demos/feedback.
- The UI in game mode is not intuitive ("cheats" exposed via the >> (forward) button), too many numbers, etc. 
- Obvious optimizations made but the thesaurus entries are read only plain text and likely 50% or more of ~20MB can be saved + a perf boost using a formally concise data structure.
- Stand alone moby.js node console app serves as a CLI reference implementation of sorts and can be fiddled with to find different paths, track down bugs, etc
- Not affiliated with the Moby Project, Grady Ward or the LDS Church.
